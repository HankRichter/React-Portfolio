        <p>
          My name is Hank Richter. I am currently a Network Technician at a
          Michigan-based ISP called 123Net. I love opportunities where I can be
          creative, as well as deplore my problem-solving skills. Thus, I have
          turned to a career in software development. I hope to continually
          update this page with projects to demonstrate my growth.
